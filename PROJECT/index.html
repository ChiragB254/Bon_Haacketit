				<p><strong>Why are data structures and algorithms so important in computer science?</strong></p>
				<p>It is axiom that data structures and algorithms are base of computer science. It is actual computer science.
					<br>
					Any developer or cs student must have to write code which provides a required output. Algorithms are methods to
					implement certain task. Algorithm is general word which suggest a process to perform task in sequential manner.
					Algorithms are developed to perform task more efficiently. If you write code as per your perception and
					judgement
					without applying any predefined algorithm, your code will be botched up after certain time. It is because you
					havenâ€™t
					applied any predefined approach or methodology.
					<br>
					Same thing happens with data structures. Data structures are like hands for algorithms to make recipe. Using
					combination<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
					of data structure and algorithms, we can improve performance of program drastically. For example, you are using
					any
					searching algorithm like binary search, then set data structure would be perfect rather than array. The reason
					is, set
					is much better for checking whether element is present in specified place or not. This is actually not a quite
					good
					example but it can tell you the actual need of data structure in algorithms.
					<br>
					Do you think that what difference would it make if we do not use any algorithm or suitable data structure? The
					ans is -
					Assume your task is to perform sorting on array of N elements. First you apply normal selection sort which is
					pretty
					easy to perform using two nested for loop. Second you apply Quick sort or merge sort which uses recursion and
					code is
					like around 50 lines with to many variables and Hodge podge. Now if the value of N is 100 or 1000, your both
					algorithm
					implementation would work perfectly without error or lag. Selection sort is O(N^2) and Merge sort is O(NlogN) so
					at max
					number of comparison will be 1M. They will not lag on i5 at all.
					<br>
					Now think that value of N is 1M. This time your selection sort will stop giving you any result. Number of
					comparison
					will be 10^12. So on i5 or i7 also, it will take few hours to complete. On the other hand, merge sort would
					require only
					10^7 moves which will take around minute (roughly) at max. So this is actual power of algorithms. Array data
					structure
					is also perfect for sorting and so that combination of both will make us happy.
					<br>
					We can say that algorithms and data structures are swords for computer science students. As much and efficiently
					you use
					them, your future will be bright for sure. I hope you understand why they are such important for us. Keep
					practicing and
					never loose hope. Enjoy coding..:)</span></p>

				<p><strong>What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the corporate world?</strong></p>
				<p>What I have learnt are a series of teeny tiny lessons which together make up for the biggest lesson.
				  <br>
				  The following are those teeny tiny lessons.
				  <br>
				  <strong>1. Everybody cares.</strong> Just that it's not about you. Nobody cares about you. They may care about many different things. You
				  are not one of those things. Care is a huge word to be throwing around in an office environment, in the corporate world.
				
				  Lesson Learnt: Don't expect people to care about you.
				  <br>
				  <strong>2. Those whom you think care about you</strong> - they only act like they do. In reality, they don't. They may care about you
				  professionally. But again, as I said, care is a huge word to be throwing around for such behaviour. They just look out
				  for you professionally at best.
				
				  Lesson Learnt: Don't trust people to have your best interest in mind.
				  <br>
				  <strong>3. Most emails are just</strong><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
				  B.S. In fact out of the 1000 emails in your inbox, you could do away without seeing at least 800 of them.
						
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Learn to manage emails and respond only for those that is directly relevant to you or something that you
				  can contribute to.
				  
				  <b>4. You're just a number.</b> You're just a raw material your company has invested in, that gives them the ROI they expect.
				  
				  Once you start failing to give them the ROI they expect, they will gladly replace you for someone else who's more
				  efficient, better, and cost efficient too. If somebody better comes along who gives a better ROI, the company won't bat
				  an eye while firing you, replacing you with that person.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Love your job, don't love your company.
				  
				  <b>5. You may think of most people around you as friends and such -</b> but, the day you leave your company - within two days,
				  you'll be forgotten. Once you're gone, nobody talks about you. Nobody remembers you. It's as if you didn't exist there.
				  
				  This is unless you were someone who was indispensable for some reason (the sole person with the knowledge of an entire
				  domain, a super-awesome manager, a top-level developer lead or something). Companies rarely let someone become
				  indispensable and irreplaceable. They always have someone readied to take your place.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't be attached to people and the place of work.
				  
				  <b>6. 99% of the people in the corporate jobs are deeply unhappy.</b>
				  
				  They are unhappy about their jobs. They are unhappy about their lives. They drown themselves in social media, movies, tv
				  shows, and other such things to avoid facing the growing unhappiness within them. They do everything in their power to
				  keeping running away from facing that unhappiness. They all know it deep down. But they are all tied - to plastic money,
				  to debts, to loans, to addictions, to liabilities, to habits, and so on. Most of them are tied to certainty.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't tie yourself to certainty. Growth happens outside of your comfort zone.
				  
				  <b>7. The remaining 1% of the people who</b> are happy are almost always the ones who love what they do to the core - the ones
				  who came to that field with a passion for what they do, and are often seen in senior or top/decorated positions with a
				  better package. They know that if they wanted to leave, they could leave and they'd immediately have another job or a
				  backup ready.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Keep improving yourself, and always keep looking out for yourself. Keep updating yourself and always be
				  ready to jump, if push comes to stove.
				  
				  <b>8. If you stand out in the work aspect of your job,</b> you'll be lauded, envied, but definitely appreciated - may not be
				  completely to what you deserve to be appreciated like, but definitely appreciated.
				  
				  But, if you stand out from the crowd in any other way, the crowd will try to make you a part of the crowd, make you into
				  following the herd, being a part of the herd. If you hold strong and if they fail, they will try the other way. They'll
				  keep mocking you and making fun of you - if you're friendly. If you're not so friendly and jovial, they'll avoid and
				  ignore you.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Corporates run on herd mentality. If you don't blend in, you're not gonna survive. But, if you make it a
				  point to stand your ground, all the while you do good work - if you get so good that they can't ignore you - then you
				  can be as you want to be, harmless, but stand out.
				  
				  <b>9. If you're single and especially if you're relatively</b> new to the company (1-2 years in the company), people in your
				  team (especially the married ones, the old guys, the seasoned ones) will mostly expect you to work late hours, late
				  nights, finish tasks well before the deadline. Especially, if they work late hours, they will definitely expect you to
				  stay.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> If you're going to tell them that you can't stay late, or you can't work weekends - they're gonna make
				  sure it reflects in your promotions, hikes, bonuses. Definitely. But, stand your ground. Otherwise, if you do as they
				  wish for you to - staying late nights, working weekends, etc., they'll expect you to do the same, even after you are
				  married.
				  
				  <b>10. If you complete your work before deadline,</b> you will be given more work (especially true when you're single).
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> When you're with the devil, learn to do the devil's work - if you're really desperate for holding on to
				  that job.
				  
				  <b>11. Most people in the corporate are unhealthy and eat shit.</b> Very few people actually build discipline around their
				  lifestyle to eat clean and healthy.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> People will tell you that this is the age you must eat all you can, that you can't eat like this once you
				  go into 30s or 40s. Those people are just full of shit. They'll try to make you eat as unhealthy as they do, because
				  they don't want to feel guilty seeing someone young, sticking to a discipline and doing what they couldn't do. If you
				  eat healthy and workout properly, you can eat anything at any age. Don't listen to people. Eat clean and healthy from
				  your 20s, if you want to have a rock solid body which is under your control in your 40s, 50s, and beyond.
				  
				  </b>12. Most people in the corporate who usually go and</b> workout at the gym think that they can eat all they want, whatever
				  they want, as long as they workout - that everything will be fine. They don't realise that if they eat crap, their body
				  will become crap soon.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't think you can work your way around shitty eating. Eating shit and working out will not solve
				  anything. Sure, you may keep a good body for a while. But all the crap you feed your body, a few years later, your body
				  will start reflecting it. You are what you eat. If you eat shit, what are you then?
				  
				  <b>13. Most meetings are irrelevant and a waste of time,</b> unless you're in a managerial, or product management position.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Find a way to avoid meetings irrelevant to you. Even then, get the minutes of the meeting from someone
				  who attended it, so that you're always up to date.
				  
				  </b>14. People will tell you they'll miss you, when you leave,</b> mostly in a farewell they organise for you (if you're a
				  senior person) or when you collect your belongings and leave (if you're relatively new). The truth is, they won't.
				  
				  <b>15. Most people in corporate are deeply in debt.</b> As their salaries increase, so do their spendings. They follow the
				  herd. They get a car. They take car financing for buying the car. They buy a home. They buy it with a housing loan.
				  Then, they marry. They marry by taking loans - for marriage, jewellery, and other expenses.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't buy the things you don't need, with the money you don't have (credit card), to impress people you
				  don't like (most around you - relatives, colleagues, etc.)
				  
				  <b>16. Words like loyalty, commitment to company, dedication towards the company's work, etc.</b>, have no place in corporate.
				  
				  Sure, there are some people who are outright loyal to their company, only as long as it suits them. You can see some
				  people working in a company for 10 years, 15 years. But, why? From the outside, it looks like they're loyal, committed
				  and dedicated to their company. If you dig deep, you'll come to know of the different reasons they've been there for
				  such a long time. Maybe it's because their family is close by from the company. Or, maybe it's because they're really
				  settled in the company, having developed expertise in their team's domain. Or, maybe it's because they want to stay
				  settled in one place. Or, maybe it's because they are so well respected in the place they are in right now, that they're
				  uncertain if they'll receive the same respect and treatment in a new place. It could be thousand other reasons. But
				  there's always a reason some people look so dedicated and loyal. In reality, if you take away those reasons, there's no
				  place for loyalty, dedication, commitment. It's all only present until it's comfortable for them, and if it suits them.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't mistake people to be loyal or committed. Don't wish to be loyal or committed. Wherever you go, just
				  strive to do the best work that you can possibly do, within the constraints of time, space, and life.
				  
				  <b>17. Most people in the corporate live to work.</b> They don't work to live.
				  
				  I best read it in this answer and comment - Faisal Khan's answer to What are the biggest lessons you have learned in the
				  corporate world?
				  
				  You can spend your entire career at the company, but once you go against them, you'll be chucked out and the entire
				  system will be against you. Years of blood, sweat and tears would be forgotten in a heartbeat and you'd be ostracized.
				  The system (i.e. the company) protects itself, no one else.
				  
				  The greatest lessons I learnt were that there is more to life than work, there are umpteen ways of earning a living and
				  one should explore that all the time, that the words like loyalty, emotional bonding, etc has no place and that one
				  needs to be connected professionally only. We devote entire lifetimes to the workplace, ignoring the family and kids,
				  and once you are out, everybody forgets you. End of the day, in the Indian situation, you are left with your sons and
				  daughters whom you neglected and you expect them to take care of you for the rest of your life. I suppose while one must
				  work sincerely and honestly, wisdom must dawn on him/her that there has to be an absolute work life balance all the
				  time,that there is more to life than work and that relationships with close friends and family and the kids is supreme.
				  Also, since many casual or even serious relationships wither away like the leaves of a plant, with new ones being in
				  place, one has to have a sense of perspective about relationships.
				  
				  Most people spend like 14-16 hours per day at work. At what cost? They rarely ever spend quality time with their family,
				  kids and spouse, parents, etc. They spend more than half their waking moments at work, as much as 8 hours in sleep. Only
				  4 to 5 hours - do they have to spend on things they love, people they love, etc. But - most of them are tired after long
				  day's work that they don't find the necessary energy to spend that time on their beloved ones. Instead, they spend that
				  time watching TV, movies, just daydreaming, or worrying.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Work for living. Don't live for working. Especially in the corporate.
				  
				  <b>18. Most people in corporate settle.</b>
				  
				  They don't keep in touch with their old friends. Their old friends move on. They move on. They try to make friends with
				  those around them - in the corporate, their colleagues. They settle for the kind of friendship they can develop - which
				  is in most cases not real. They don't go out during weekends. If they do, they go to fill their soul with temporary
				  fillings - like movies, pubs, drugs, etc. They settle for a soulless life.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Don't settle.
				  
				  <b>19. They sacrifice most of their time at work and expect to bring up a fully functional family.</b>
				  
				  Most of the time, when you spend like 14-16 hours at work, you end up becoming a stranger to your spouse and your kids.
				  Your spouse and kids become a kind of a mechanical commitment rather than being life and soul-oriented relationships.
				  People usually become unhappy and disgruntled in their marriage. They try to make up for the hollow feeling they feel
				  with a lot of possessions, intermittent vacations, buying a lot of things, spending a lot of money on their spouse and
				  kids. They don't realise that their kids and spouse don't need a lot of money, but, rather, they need some time of
				  theirs.
				  
				  Sometimes, when the family grows up to be fully functional, it's either the work of their spouse or the work of other
				  factors involved in the family's upbringing (maybe the presence of grandparents, or presence of another father figure in
				  an uncle or a neighbour, etc.)
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Always spend time with your family, one way or the other. Coz, even when your company ditches you, it's
				  your family you're gonna fall back onto.
				  
				  <b>20. Most people don't have a separation of personal from the professional.</b>
				  
				  Most people take professional woes to home. They bring personal woes to office. They don't have a separation of concern
				  in their life. Their corporate life experience has such a major role that the kind of tension and stress that is created
				  around them is also carried to their home.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b> Keep the professional away from the personal. Don't get personal with professional.
				  
				  <b>21. To not indulge in workplace romance.</b>
				  
				  Workplace romances are common. When it's a hit, you've got an amazing thing - both working at the same place,
				  relationship strong, everything good, everyone happy (once you get married). You also get to spend more time together.
				  
				  When it's a miss, when it fails, it's a sour sour thing to face. Especially going through the pain of seeing the other
				  person every single day, that's not for the faint-hearted. When the workplace romance fails, it has a pretty huge
				  negative impact on your psyche - at the workplace.
				  
				  <b>Lesson Learnt:</b>
				  
				  Keep your relationship and everything related to relationship outside of your office, even if it is with someone from
				  inside the office.
				  
				  Keep your relationship as secretive as possible from your colleagues and office people. Don't make it obvious. This
				  helps in alleviating the after-effects of a break-up if it happens.
				  
				  Keep your personal away from the professional.</span></p>
